# My-CPP-Learning-Projects
An intermediate Java developer trying to document his journey learning C++.

## Why
 - I intend to write and comment C++ code to help developers understand how C++ works and why it works that way.
 - To create a reference point for future C++ lessons.

## What this entails
I shall be using oriely's practical programming and various trusted sources such as TutorialsPoint, GeeksForGeeks among other websites to document my code.

## How to use this
1. Use repository to learn basics of CPP
2. Fork this repository and submit a PR about to a topic on C++
3. As a reference point for CPP related questions or projects

## How It's Structured
After each lesson I shall compile all code files in a folder that is given a distinct topic as seen below

## File Structure

**Topic** | **Link** |
-----|------|
Hello World / Introduction | [helloworld/helloworld.cpp](helloworld/helloworld.cpp) |
Data Types / GameScore | [datatypes/gamescore.cpp](datatypes/gamescore.cpp) |
Data Types / Booleans | [datatypes/booleans.cpp](datatypes/booleans.cpp) |
Understanding Scopes | [scopes/understanding_scopes.cpp](scopes/understanding_scopes.cpp) |
**Strings / string.h functions** | [strings/string_functions.cpp](strings/string_functions.cpp) |
**I/O / Area of circle** | [i_o/areaofcircle.cpp](i_o/areaofcircle.cpp) |
Sorting / Bubble Sort | [loops/sort_array.cpp](loops/sort_array.cpp) |
Recursion / Print Hello World 10 times | [recursion/print_helloworld_ten_times.cpp](recursion/print_helloworld_ten_times.cpp) |
